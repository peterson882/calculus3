Recall,

\section{A new fundamental theorem of calculus}

\begin{theorem}[Green's Theorem]
  If $\vec{F}$ has continuous partial derivatives and $C$ is a
  boundray of a closed region $R$ and $\vec{p}(t)$ paramaterizes $C$
  in a counterclockwise direction with the interior on the left, then
  \[
  \int_R \curl\vec{F}\d A = \int_C \vec{F}\dotp\d\vec{p} 
  \]
\end{theorem}
