\title[Dig-In:]{Vector fields}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
  We introduce the idea of a vector at every point in space.

Up to this point in our study of calculus, we have investigated functions
\[
f:\R \to \R
\]
Typically we interpert these functions as being curves in the $(x,y)$-plane:
\begin{image}
  need a graph
\end{image}
We've also studied vector valued functions
\[
\vec{f}:\R \to \R^n
\]
We can interpert these as parametric curves in space:
\begin{image}
  Need a graph
\end{image}

We've studied functions of several variables
\[
F:\R^n \to \R
\]
We interpert these a surfaces in $\R^{n+1}$,


Now we study vector-valued functions of several variables
\[
\vec{F}:\R^n\to R^n
\]
and we intererpert these as \textit{vector fields}, meaning for each
point in the $(x,y)$-plane we have a vector.
\begin{image}
\end{image}

Let's be explicit
\begin{definiiton}
  A \dfn{vector field} in $\R^n$ is a function
  \[
  \vec{F}: \R^n\to\R^n
  \]
\end{definiiton}
